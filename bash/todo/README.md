So, I create todo lists for myself. Simple, markdown-formatted lists.
Each entry in the list starts with a single dash (-).

Since I sometimes have difficulty deciding what to work on next,
my time management could always be more efficient, and there is always
a list of things to do, I decided to make things easier on myself and
thoroughly more fun by leaving scheduling decisions up to a PRNG.

This has multiple advantages, namely:
   -  Items I would normally put off doing indefinitely because there's
      always something more immediate will eventually get done,
   -  No time will be wasted weighing the options, and
   -  This code can always be repurposed to work as a fun divertisement
      a la /usr/games/fortune.

Anyway, this uses ANSI VT100 escape sequences. So, make sure you use
a sane terminal and you'll be fine.
