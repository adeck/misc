# What is this?

It's a script that scrapes a webpage from WSU for agricultural data, and then outputs a CSV of harvesting seasons for various produce.

# How do I run this?

You need python3 installed, and then (from this directory) run:

```
./run.sh
```

If you're curious, I recommend you read that script.
It's a very short script.
